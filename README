This repo is for those who are just getting started with Emacs. The
configuration is based around programming in Lisp but offers some
other features.  I use Emacs on OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Mac OS X so there
are some personal settings in there to reflect different installation
locations.  Simply change the path on those and you'll be all set.

Works best with SBCL, Redshank, paredit and SLIME.

Good luck.
